This project takes a set of DNA strands - a sequence of nucleotide base pairs represented by A,T,C, and G - and identifies pairwise differences between 
the nucleotide bases from each DNA strand. We can compare deletions and insertions within the two DNA strands to identify points of difference and overall similarities.
